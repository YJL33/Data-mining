Problem 1

Input
Each line represents an edge between 2 people.

Output
Each line [X, Y, Z] represents an indirect connection between X and Y via Z.
X and Y should be sorted in alphabetical order. e.g., if there is an indirect connection between bill and mary via david, the output line should be ["bill", "mary", "david"] instead of ["mary", "bill", "david"] or anything else.


Problem 2

Input
Each line represents a chunk of integers.

Output
A single value of the descriptive variance of integers in all chunks.
Do not round the result, just leave it as what python would output.


Also note that we will be testing your code with different input files in the same format, please do not include any hard coding in your script.
